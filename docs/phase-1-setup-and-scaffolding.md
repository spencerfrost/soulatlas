- Set up project structure for modular visualizations
- Research and define JSON schemas for:
  - Parts
  - Core beliefs

  - Relationships
- Review previous ChatGPT conversations for schema/data inspiration
- Create initial example JSON data files based on your personal journey
- Document the data structure and schema decisions
- Set up basic global styles and color palette (calm, therapy-inspired)
- Prepare the app for easy addition of new visualizations

## Deliverables

- Working React app with Tailwind and ShadCN configured
- Project structure ready for modular visualizations
- JSON schema definitions and example data files
- Documentation for setup and data approach
