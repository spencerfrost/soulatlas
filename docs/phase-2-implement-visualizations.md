# Phase 2: Implement Visualizations

## Objective

Develop and integrate the core visualizations for the app, each following a consistent research, design, and implementation workflow.

## Visualization Workflow (for each type)

1. **Research**
   - Investigate best practices and technologies for the visualization (e.g., React Flow, D3, Vis.js)
   - Review relevant therapy/self-exploration concepts and user needs
2. **Design**
   - Define the data requirements and structure for the visualization
   - Sketch or wireframe the UI and interactivity
   - Decide on color, style, and accessibility considerations
3. **Implementation**
   - Build the visualization component
   - Integrate with JSON data
   - Implement interactive features (e.g., click, highlight, details)
   - Test for usability and responsiveness

## Visualizations to Implement

- Parts Map
- Core Beliefs Tree
- Emotion-Behavior Cycle Chart
- Life Timeline
- Relationship Map (optional for MVP)

## Deliverables

- Fully functional, interactive visualizations integrated into the app
- Documentation for each visualization’s data structure and usage
- UI/UX consistent with the app’s calming, accessible design
